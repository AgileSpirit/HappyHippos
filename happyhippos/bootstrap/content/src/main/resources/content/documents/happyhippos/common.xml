&lt;p&gt;Pixar Animation Studios, or simply Pixar (/ˈpɪksɑr/, stylized as PIXAR), is
an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California. The
studio is best known for its CGI-animated feature films created with
PhotoRealistic RenderMan, its own implementation of the industry-standard
RenderMan image-rendering application programming interface used to generate
high-quality images. Pixar began in 1979 as the Graphics Group, part of the
computer division of Lucasfilm before its spin-out as a corporation in 1986 with
funding by Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, who became its majority
shareholder.[1] The Walt Disney Company bought Pixar in 2006 at a valuation of
$7.4 billion, a transaction which made Jobs Disney's largest shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixar has produced fourteen feature films, beginning with Toy Story in 1995.
Thirteen of the films have received both critical and financial success, with
the notable exception being Cars 2, which, while commercially successful,
received substantially less praise than Pixar's other productions.[2] All
fourteen films have debuted with CinemaScore ratings of at least "A-",
indicating a very positive reception with audiences.[3] The studio has also
produced several short films. As of December 2013, its feature films have made
over $8.5 billion worldwide,[4] with an average worldwide gross of $607 million
per film.[5] Both Finding Nemo and Toy Story 3 are among the 50 highest-grossing
films of all time, and all of Pixar's films are among the 50 highest-grossing
animated films, with Toy Story 3 being the all-time highest, grossing over $1
billion worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studio has earned 27 Academy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and
eleven Grammy Awards, among many other awards and acknowledgments. Since the
award's inauguration in 2001, most of Pixar's films have been nominated for the
Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, with seven winning: Finding Nemo, The
Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Toy Story 3, and Brave (with Monsters Inc.
and Cars being the only two just being nominated for the award). Up and Toy
Story 3 were the second and third animated films to be nominated for the Academy
Award for Best Picture (the first being Beauty and the Beast). On September 6,
2009, executives John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and Lee
Unkrich were presented with the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement by the
Biennale Venice Film Festival. The award was presented by Lucasfilm founder
George Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Early history &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixar was founded as The Graphics Group, which was one third of the Computer
Division of Lucasfilm that was launched in 1979 with the hiring of Dr. Ed
Catmull from the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT), where he was in charge
of the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL). At NYIT, the researchers pioneered many of
the CG foundation techniques—in particular the invention of the "alpha channel"
(by Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith); years later the CGL produced an experimental
film called The Works. After moving to Lucasfilm, the team worked on creating
the precursor to RenderMan, called REYES (for "renders everything you ever
saw"); and developed a number of critical technologies for CG—including
"particle effects" and various animation tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1982, the team began working on film sequences with Industrial Light &amp;amp;
Magic on special effects. After years of research, and key milestones in films
such as the Genesis Effect in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and the Stained
Glass Knight in Young Sherlock Holmes, the group, which numbered 40 individuals
back then,[1] was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 with investment by
Steve Jobs shortly after he left Apple Computer.[1] Jobs paid $5 million to
George Lucas for technology rights and put them and $5 million cash as capital
into the company. A factor contributing to Lucas' sale was an increase in cash
flow difficulties following his 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden
dropoff in revenues from Star Wars licenses following the release of Return of
the Jedi. The newly independent company was headed by Dr. Edwin Catmull as
President and Dr. Alvy Ray Smith as Executive Vice President. They were joined
on the Board of Directors by Steve Jobs who was Chairman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, while awaiting the consequences of Moore's law, that would reduce
the cost of computing a film, Pixar was a high-end computer hardware company
whose core product was the Pixar Image Computer, a system primarily sold to
government agencies and the medical community. One of the buyers of Pixar Image
Computers was Walt Disney Studios, which was using the device as part of their
secretive CAPS project, using the machine and custom software (written by Pixar)
to migrate the laborious ink and paint part of the 2-D animation process to a
more automated and thus efficient method. The Image Computer never sold well. In
a bid to drive sales of the system, Pixar employee John Lasseter—who had long
been creating short demonstration animations, such as Luxo Jr., to show off the
device's capabilities—premiered his creations at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics
industry's largest convention, to great fanfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As poor sales of Pixar's computers threatened to put the company out of
business, Jobs invested more and more money and took more and more ownership
away from the management and employees until after several years he owned
essentially all the company for a total investment of $50 million. Lasseter's
animation department began producing computer-animated commercials for outside
companies. Early successes included campaigns for Tropicana, Listerine, and Life
Savers. In April 1990 Pixar sold its hardware division, including all
proprietary hardware technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and
transferred 18 of Pixar's approximately 100 employees. The same year Pixar moved
from San Rafael to Richmond, California. During this period, Pixar continued its
successful relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation, a studio whose
corporate parent would ultimately become its most important partner. In 1991,
after a tough start of the year when about 30 employees in the company's
computer department had to go (including the company's president, Chuck
Kolstad), which reduced the total number of employees to just 42, essentially
its original number, Pixar made a $26 million deal with Disney to produce three
computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story. At that
point, the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and CAPS, and
Lasseter’s animation department, who made television commercials, some 3-D
Stings for Nickelodeon, and a few shorts for Sesame Street, was all that was
left of Pixar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the total income of these products, the company was still losing
money, and Jobs, still chairman of the board and now the full owner, often
considered selling it. Even as late as 1994, Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to
other companies, among them Microsoft. Only after learning from New York critics
that Toy Story was probably going to be a success and confirming that Disney
would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season did he decide to give Pixar
another chance. He also began then for the first time to take an active direct
leadership role in the company, making himself its CEO. The film went on to
gross more than $361 million worldwide. Later that year, Pixar held its initial
public offering on November 29, 1995, and the company's stock was priced at
US$22 per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixar built a new studio in Emeryville which opened in November 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disney &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixar and Disney had disagreements after the production of Toy Story 2.
Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's
three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release
during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the
three-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Though profitable for both, Pixar
later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible
for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution.
Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all
story and sequel rights and also collected a distribution fee. The lack of story
and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage
for a contentious relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004. The new
deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and
own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to finance
their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney
only the 10 to 15 percent distribution fee. More importantly, as part of any
distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in
production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles and Cars. Disney
considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then Disney Chairman and CEO Michael
Eisner made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been.
They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Jobs declaring that Pixar was
actively seeking partners other than Disney. Despite this announcement, Pixar
did not enter negotiations with other distributors. After a lengthy hiatus,
negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner
from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between
Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release
movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative
early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major
releases during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying Cars
was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract to see how
things would play out between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar, the two companies created a
distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, in case the
acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released
through Disney's distribution channels. (In contrast to the earlier Disney/Pixar
deal, Ratatouille was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received
only a distribution fee.) The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however,
nullified this distribution arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney had agreed to buy Pixar for approximately $7.4 billion in an all-stock
deal. Following Pixar shareholder approval, the acquisition was completed May 5,
2006. The transaction catapulted Steve Jobs, who was the majority shareholder of
Pixar with 50.1%, to Disney's largest individual shareholder with 7% and a new
seat on its board of directors. Jobs' new Disney holdings exceeded holdings
belonging to ex-CEO Michael Eisner, the previous top shareholder, who still held
1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus Roy E. Disney, who held almost 1% of the
corporation's shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, John Lasseter, by then Executive Vice President, became
Chief Creative Officer (reporting to President and CEO Robert Iger and
consulting with Disney Director Roy Disney) of both Pixar and Walt Disney
Animation Studios, as well as the Principal Creative Adviser at Walt Disney
Imagineering, which designs and builds the company's theme parks. Catmull
retained his position as President of Pixar, while also becoming President of
Walt Disney Animation Studios, reporting to Bob Iger and Dick Cook, chairman of
Walt Disney Studio Entertainment. Steve Jobs' position as Pixar's Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer was also removed, and instead he took a place on the
Disney board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lasseter and Catmull's oversight of both the Disney and Pixar studios did not
mean that the two studios were merging, however. In fact, additional conditions
were laid out as part of the deal to ensure that Pixar remained a separate
entity, a concern that analysts had expressed about the Disney deal. Some of
those conditions were that Pixar HR policies would remain intact, including the
lack of employment contracts. Also, the Pixar name was guaranteed to continue,
and the studio would remain in its current Emeryville, California location with
the "Pixar" sign. Finally, branding of films made post-merger would be
"Disney•Pixar" (beginning with Cars).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Morris, producer of WALL-E, became general manager of Pixar. In this new
position, Morris took charge of the day-to-day running of the studio facilities
and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expansion &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 20, 2010, Pixar Animation Studios opened a new studio in the
downtown area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The roughly 2,000 square
meters studio primarily produced shorts and TV specials based on characters from
Pixar's feature films. The studio's first production was the Cars Toons episode,
"Air Mater." In October 2013, the studio was closed.&lt;/p&gt;
